# BDD Trader application

The BDD Trader application was used as part of the Testing REST APIs with Serenity BDD and RestAssured course to learn Agile Test Automation at the Serenity Dojo Academy.  

The API documentation can be found at the following location: https://bddtrader.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/.

In the exercises I demonstrate testing REST APIs using REST Assured, Serenity BDD, Maven, JUnit and Hamcrest Matcher with Java. 

# Goal 

The goal of the exercises included writing API tests that:

• Retrieved resources with **GET queries**

• Located items using **JSON Path** 

• Checked resources using **Hamcrest Matchers**

• Created new resources with **POST methods**

• Updated resources using **PUT methods**

• Deleted resource using **DELETE request**

# Techniques Learned

I learned how to work with **JSON Path** to find an item within the JSON and then use **Hamcrest Matcher** to make assertions about what should be in the JSON. We also covered **JSON expressions that return collections**.   

I also practised using a variety of API methods, see the list under the goals section above.
